For use in the trade value algorithm, figure out how contract amount changes with player value.

Data comes after simming 5 seasons, so waiting for it to stabilize.

Basketball:

    local.playerOvrMean: 44.88120567375886
    local.playerOvrStd: 11.120793951909148

Football:

    local.playerOvrMean: 45.66901027582477
    local.playerOvrStd: 12.94063146944189

This is just to give a rough visualization, not to set parameters.
