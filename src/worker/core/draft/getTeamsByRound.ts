/**
 * Differences across sports:
 *
 * Basketball
 * - lottery is for non-playoff teams only
 * - after lottery, order is based on record, not playoff results
 * - tied teams in lottery split the total chances (handled in divideChancesOverTiedTeams.ts)
 * - tiebreaker is random - but make it deterministic so it doesn't jump when doing the lottery
 * - 2nd round tiebreaker is opposite of 1st round
 * - 2nd round order is just based on record, no lottery section for non-playoff teams
 *
 * Football
 * - order is based on playoff results
 * - tiebreaker is different than for playoffs, but i could probably get away with using the same one
 * - tied teams rotate (like 123 -> 231 -> 312 -> 123) in later rounds
 * - besides tiebreakers, order is same in all rounds
 *
 * Hockey
 * - lottery is like basketball, but sort based on points rather than winp
 * - then: playoff teams that did not win their divisions and did not make the conference finals, sorted by points
 * - then: playoff teams that won their divisions and did not make the conference finals, sorted by points
 * - then: conference finals losers sorted by points are assigned picks 29 and 30
 * - then: finals loser
 * - then: finals winner
 * - 2nd+ round same as 1st round, but with lottery teams ordered by points
 * - tiebreaker is different than for playoffs, but i could probably get away with using the same one
 * - tiebreaker order is the same in every round
