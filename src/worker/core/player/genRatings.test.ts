/**
 * This is not actually a test, it's a script to see what the quartiles of ovr ratings look like for different draftAge settings, for use when parametrizing the age adjustment in genRatings.
 *
 * Run this like (after unskipping the test):
 *
 * $ SPORT=basketball yarn jest src/worker/core/player/genRatings.test.ts | grep QUARTILES
 *
 * It's in jest rather than node.js because jest has all the imports and crap set up.
